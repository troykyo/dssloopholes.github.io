Closed-loop water systems and renewable energy are two pivotal elements in the pursuit of sustainable fashion production. Closed-loop water systems refer to technologies and practices that enable the recycling and reuse of water within production processes, significantly reducing the demand for fresh water and minimizing wastewater discharge. This approach is crucial in an industry known for its high water consumption and pollution, as it helps conserve water resources and reduces the environmental footprint associated with garment manufacturing.

Renewable energy, on the other hand, involves the use of energy sources that are naturally replenished, such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. By transitioning to renewable energy, the fashion industry can reduce its reliance on fossil fuels, which are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. Utilizing renewable energy in fashion production not only helps lower carbon emissions but also supports the shift towards more environmentally friendly and resilient energy infrastructures.

The integration of closed-loop water systems and renewable energy into the fashion production process represents a significant step towards achieving a circular economy. This model emphasizes the continuous use of resources, where waste is minimized, and materials are kept in use for as long as possible. By adopting these sustainable practices, fashion brands can decrease their environmental impact, conserve valuable resources, and contribute to the global effort to combat climate change.

Incorporating closed-loop water systems and renewable energy into the fashion industry involves innovative approaches and technological advancements. For example, implementing water treatment facilities that clean and recycle water on-site can dramatically reduce the amount of fresh water needed in production. Similarly, installing solar panels or wind turbines to power factories and production facilities can cut down on energy costs and reduce dependence on non-renewable energy sources.

The benefits of these practices extend beyond environmental sustainability. They can also lead to cost savings in the long term, enhance brand reputation, and meet the growing consumer demand for eco-friendly products. Moreover, they align with global sustainability goals, such as the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which call for responsible consumption and production (SDG 12) and affordable and clean energy (SDG 7).

### Case studies

#### Trikotek – Circular Denim Facility with Closed-Loop Water and Renewable Energy  
Turkish knitwear and denim producer Trikotek operates a washing facility where 98% of process water is recycled and the remaining 2% is lost through evaporation, achieving zero liquid discharge from washing. The company also reports running production on clean, renewable energy, directly coupling water circularity with decarbonised electricity in textile finishing.

#### ACQUA360 – Closed-Loop Water for Tuscan Tanning District  
The ACQUA360 project in the Santa Croce sull’Arno tanning district (Italy) pilots a centralized purification and refinement plant to recycle tannery wastewater back into process water. By supplying recycled water to multiple tanneries at industrial scale, the project lays the groundwork for a district-level closed-loop water infrastructure in the leather value chain.

#### WASTE2FRESH – EU Textile Wastewater Closed-Loop Demonstration  
WASTE2FRESH is an EU Horizon 2020 project that develops a hybrid system combining advanced oxidation, membrane filtration, and smart monitoring to enable near-zero liquid discharge in textile finishing. The project’s industrial demonstrator at a denim factory shows how integrated treatment can continuously recycle process water, drastically reducing freshwater intake and pollutant discharge.

#### SAITEX – “The World’s Cleanest Denim Factory”  
SAITEX, a Vietnamese denim manufacturer supplying multiple global brands, is widely cited for its closed-loop water and energy system. The factory treats and recycles roughly 98% of its process water on-site and relies heavily on renewable energy and high-efficiency equipment, positioning denim laundering and finishing within a low-impact, near-closed-loop infrastructure.

#### ECWRTI – Electro-Coagulation Based Water Reuse in Textile Finishing  
The ECWRTI project (Electro Coagulation and Wastewater Reuse Technology for the Textile Industry) demonstrates a treatment train that combines electro-coagulation, filtration, and reverse osmosis to close the water loop in a textile finishing line. By enabling high-quality water reuse and reducing discharge, ECWRTI offers a scalable pathway for mills to move toward circular water management with lower overall resource use.
