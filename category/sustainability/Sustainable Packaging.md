    <h3> Sustainable Packaging </h3>
Alternative solutions for packaging including biobased or recycled materials, increase the reuse of packaging, while minimizing the impact for example by reducing the amount and impact of packaging used.

### Case studies

#### PUMA – Clever Little Bag
PUMA collaborated with design firm fuseproject to replace traditional cardboard shoeboxes with the Clever Little Bag, a minimalist cardboard tray combined with a reusable fabric bag. This packaging concept reduces cardboard use, lowers transport emissions through volume reduction, and encourages reuse of the fabric bag, demonstrating how apparel brands can redesign packaging systems to cut material use and waste.

#### Lush – Naked and Low-Packaging Formats
Lush has systematically reduced primary and secondary packaging by developing “naked” products (such as solid shampoos and conditioners) and offering refill schemes for selected lines. Their naked strategy illustrates how a brand can shift entire product portfolios to formats that eliminate or radically reduce packaging while using recycled or reusable containers where packaging is still needed.

#### Patagonia – Polybag Reduction and Packaging Redesign
Patagonia has analysed the life cycle impacts of its polybags and experimented with folding, recycled content, and alternative materials to reduce plastic use in apparel packaging. Case analysis of Patagonia’s packaging initiatives shows how changing folding methods, increasing recycled content, and exploring reusable/biodegradable options can significantly lower packaging-related impacts for garments.

#### Nudie Jeans – Recycled and Recyclable Packaging
Nudie Jeans integrates circular principles into its packaging by prioritising recycled paper, eliminating unnecessary plastics, and aligning packaging formats with recyclability in local waste systems. Sectoral reporting on fashion packaging highlights Nudie’s use of FSC-certified and high-recycled-content packaging as part of a broader circular denim strategy that also includes repair and reuse.

#### Picture Organic Clothing – Paper-Based and Reusable Solutions
Picture Organic Clothing has shifted from conventional plastic mailers and boxes towards recycled cardboard and paper-based solutions, supported by reusable bags and minimised material weights. Documented as a case in global overviews of sustainable fashion packaging, Picture’s approach demonstrates how outdoor and board-sports apparel brands can align packaging with wider commitments to low-impact materials and circular design.
