    <h3> Post-use Materials </h3>
 Post-use materials are textiles and garments that have finished their initial use. These textiles are recycled or upcycled to create new products, promoting a circular economy.
    <br><br><strong> VET: </strong>
How can we use old clothes and materials to make new things instead of throwing them away?
    <br><br><strong> HEI: </strong>
What are the challenges and opportunities associated with integrating post-use materials into new fashion products, and how can designers overcome these to support a circular economy?

Post-Use Materials refers to materials that have been previously used by users and are no longer needed in their original form. In the fashion domain, post-use materials typically refer to textiles and clothing items that have reached the end of their life cycle and are ready for disposal or recycling.

Post-use materials encompass various types of textiles and garments that have served their primary purpose and are no longer suitable for continued use. These materials can include worn-out or damaged clothing, discarded textile scraps, surplus inventory, or even products returned by customers. Instead of being discarded as waste, these materials can be redirected into recycling or upcycling processes to create new products or extend their lifespan.

The concept of post-use materials aligns with the principles of circular economy and sustainable fashion. Rather than perpetuating a linear "take-make-dispose" model, post-use materials present an opportunity to recover and reintegrate valuable resources back into the fashion supply chain. By collecting, sorting, and processing these materials, fashion brands and manufacturers can reduce the environmental impact associated with production and minimize waste generation.

In addition to recycling, post-use materials can also be repurposed or upcycled. Repurposing involves transforming the materials into new products or applications, while upcycling entails creating higher-value products from the existing materials. These approaches contribute to the reduction of resource consumption and promote a more sustainable and circular fashion industry.

### Case studies

#### Worn Again Technologies – Textile-to-textile recycling of post-use polyester–cotton blends  
Worn Again Technologies develops chemical recycling processes that separate and recover polyester and cellulose from end-of-use textiles and polyester packaging. Their technology enables high-quality fiber-to-fiber recycling of blended post-use materials, turning discarded garments back into new textile feedstock and directly supporting a circular fashion economy.

#### Patagonia – Worn Wear  
Patagonia’s Worn Wear program collects, repairs, and resells post-use Patagonia garments, as well as recycling items that can no longer be repaired. By designing for durability, enabling repair at scale, and creating a dedicated resale channel, Worn Wear extends product lifetimes and demonstrates how post-use materials can be systematically re-integrated into the value chain.

#### MUD Jeans – Lease A Jeans and take-back recycling  
MUD Jeans operates a “Lease A Jeans” model in which users lease denim and return it at end-of-use, after which the company collects, disassembles, and recycles post-use jeans into new denim fabrics with high recycled-content. This system turns worn garments into feedstock, reducing reliance on virgin cotton and showcasing a circular model built around post-use materials.

#### For Days – Closed-loop apparel and take-back bags  
For Days is a closed-loop apparel brand that sells garments designed for recyclability and operates a take-back system using return “Swap Bags” for any brand’s post-use textiles. Returned items are sorted for reuse or mechanically/chemically recycled into new products, exemplifying how brand-led logistics and design can mobilise post-use materials at scale.

#### Evrnu – NuCycl fiber from post-use textiles  
Evrnu’s NuCycl technology transforms post-use cotton-rich textiles into regenerated cellulose fibers with performance comparable to virgin materials. Working with global brands and mills, Evrnu demonstrates how advanced fiber regeneration can convert discarded garments into high-value yarns, closing material loops for the apparel sector.
