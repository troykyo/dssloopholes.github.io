    <h3> Design for Repairability (DfR) </h3>
Making somthing that it is easy to repair is an artform. Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) requires repair (or recycling) of garments by the brand who sold it. Designing for the repair of the garment from the beginning makes the process easier and reuse/resale possible.
    <br><br><strong> VET: </strong>
What can you change in your current clothing to make it more repairable?  
<br><br><strong> HEI: </strong>
How can you Design for Repair (DfR) in a circular process? How might that change if seven years pass for the garment to go back to the company?

Enabling Repairability refers to the intentional design and production of fashion items that allow for easy and effective repair and maintenance. It involves incorporating durable materials, modular designs, and accessible repair services and resources to extend the life-cycle of fashion products and promote sustainable consumption patterns.

To enable repairability, fashion brands focus on several key aspects. First, they prioritize the selection of durable and high-quality materials that can withstand wear and tear. This includes using strong stitching, reinforced seams, and robust fabrics that are less prone to damage. By choosing materials with longevity in mind, brands create products that can be repaired and maintained over time.

In addition to materials, the design of fashion items plays a crucial role in enabling repairability. Brands may adopt modular designs, where different components of a garment can be easily replaced or repaired without affecting the overall integrity of the piece. For example, a jacket with detachable and interchangeable buttons or a pair of shoes with replaceable soles allows for specific parts to be fixed or replaced rather than discarding the entire item.

Furthermore, enabling repairability involves providing access to repair services and resources. Brands may collaborate with skilled artisans or partner with repair workshops to offer repair services for their products. They may also provide customers with repair kits, guidelines, or tutorials that empower them to perform minor repairs themselves. By facilitating repair options, brands encourage customers to extend the life of their fashion items instead of replacing them.

Moreover, a comprehensive approach to enabling repairability also includes considerations for the availability and accessibility of spare parts. Brands may maintain inventories of replacement buttons, zippers, clasps, or other components, ensuring that customers can easily obtain the necessary parts for repairs. They may also establish partnerships with suppliers or retailers to ensure the availability of these components for an extended period.

Overall, enabling repairability in the fashion domain involves a holistic approach to design, materials, resources, and services. By prioritizing durability, adopting modular designs, providing repair services and resources, and ensuring the availability of spare parts, brands empower customers to prolong the life of their fashion items through repairs. This approach promotes sustainability, reduces waste, and encourages a shift towards a more circular fashion industry.

### Case studies

#### Patagonia – Worn Wear & Repair Services  
Patagonia integrates design for repairability with its Worn Wear program, offering in-house repair services, mail-in repairs, and detailed repair guides so garments can stay in use for as long as possible. The brand designs products with durable constructions and replaceable components (e.g., zippers, panels), explicitly linking repair services to product design and extended producer responsibility.

#### Nudie Jeans – Free Repairs for Life  
Nudie Jeans designs its denim with robust construction and classic detailing so that jeans can be repaired repeatedly rather than replaced. Through its global network of Repair Shops and partners, the brand offers free repairs for life on its jeans, embedding repairability into both product design and its circular business model.

#### Arc’teryx – ReBird Repair Program  
Arc’teryx’s ReBird initiative combines product design, repair, resale, and upcycling, with a dedicated repair service that replaces damaged components such as zips, panels, and hardware. Garments are engineered for technical longevity, and the repair program operationalises design-for-repair decisions by restoring high-value outdoor products to functional use instead of replacement.

#### Cotopaxi – Guaranteed for Good Repair Program  
Cotopaxi’s “Guaranteed for Good” policy explicitly commits the brand to repairing or replacing products that fail in normal use. Their product development emphasises durable, repairable construction, while the repair program provides a practical pathway for keeping garments and equipment in circulation and delaying end-of-life.

#### iFixit – Clothing & Gear Repair Guides  
iFixit supports design for repairability at ecosystem level by publishing open repair guides and tools for a wide range of products, including clothing, outdoor gear, and accessories. By making step-by-step textile and hardware repair instructions freely accessible, it lowers the barrier for brands and wearers to design, maintain, and repair garments instead of discarding them.
