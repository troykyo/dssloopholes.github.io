    <h3> EcoDesign </h3>
 EcoDesign is a design approach that considers the entire life cycle of a product, from its conception to the end of its useful life, with the aim of minimising waste and environmental impact, EcoDesign includes a synthesis of innovative design strategies, sustainable material choices, and comprehensive end-of-lives management.

EcoDesign is an approach that integrates environmental considerations into every stage of a product's life cycle, from its initial concept through to its end of life. The primary goal of EcoDesign is to minimize the negative environmental impacts associated with the design, production, use, and disposal of products. This holistic approach not only addresses the environmental challenges of waste and pollution but also encourages innovation in sustainable material choices and product design strategies.
At the heart of EcoDesign is the principle of considering the entire life cycle of a product. This means evaluating the environmental impact of every phase, including raw material extraction, manufacturing processes, distribution, usage, and ultimately, the product's disposal or recycling. By understanding and optimizing each stage, designers can create products that are not only functional and appealing but also environmentally responsible.
One of the key aspects of EcoDesign is the selection of sustainable materials. This involves choosing materials that are renewable, recyclable, or have a lower environmental footprint. For example, using organic cotton instead of conventional cotton reduces water usage and pesticide application. Additionally, incorporating recycled or upcycled materials can reduce the demand for virgin resources and decrease waste.
Incorporating EcoDesign principles into fashion can lead to products that are not only better for the planet but also resonate more with consumers who are increasingly aware of environmental issues. By creating products that are sustainable, durable, and designed with their entire life cycle in mind, brands can appeal to eco-conscious consumers and build a reputation for environmental responsibility.

### Case studies

#### Veja – Sneakers with a conscience  
Veja integrates EcoDesign principles by specifying organic, Fairtrade cotton, wild and fairly traded Amazonian rubber, and recycled materials, while designing sneakers for durability and repairability. Their transparent disclosure of material origins, supplier practices, and long-lasting construction foregrounds life-cycle impacts from fibre to end-of-life, positioning the product as a lower-impact alternative to conventional athletic footwear.

#### Outerknown – Recirculating surf and outdoor apparel  
Outerknown builds its collections around organic, recycled, and regenerated fibres (e.g. Econyl) and publishes strict fibre and factory standards that target reduced water, chemical, and climate impacts. By pairing durable design with take-back and repair offers where possible and vetting partners through Fair Labor Association accreditation, Outerknown operationalises EcoDesign as a combination of material choice, responsible manufacturing, and extended product lifetimes.

#### PANGAIA – Materials science–driven EcoDesign  
PANGAIA operates as a materials-science fashion company that engineers bio-based and recycled textiles (e.g. seaweed fibre, FLWRDWN, recycled cotton blends) and low-impact dye systems. Garments are designed with clear fibre labelling, recyclability or compostability pathways, and reduced chemical and water footprints, demonstrating how EcoDesign can be anchored in upstream fibre innovation and end-of-life scenarios.

#### GANNI – Life-cycle focused “Responsibility Gameplan”  
GANNI’s Responsibility strategy commits to phasing out virgin leather and conventional silk, scaling certified and recycled fibres, and piloting circular services such as rental (GANNI Repeat) and resale. By coupling product design guidelines (preferred fibres, restricted substances, durability criteria) with business-model experiments that keep garments in circulation longer, GANNI connects EcoDesign decisions at sketch stage to measurable life-cycle impact reductions.

#### VAUDE – Green Shape EcoDesign standard  
VAUDE’s Green Shape label codifies EcoDesign requirements across the full product life cycle, including strict criteria on certified materials, reparability, PFC-free finishes, and recyclability. Using life-cycle assessment, design guidelines, and take-back / repair services, VAUDE demonstrates how an outdoor brand can systematise EcoDesign into a verifiable standard that governs development from concept to end-of-life.
