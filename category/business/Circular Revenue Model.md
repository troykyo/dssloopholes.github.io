**Circular revenue models** focus on generating income while promoting sustainability by **recycling**, **upcycling**, and **reusing materials**. These models offer fashion companies the opportunity to create value not only through direct sales but also by adopting innovative approaches such as **subscription services**, **rental models**, and **digital platforms**. By aligning their revenue strategies with sustainable practices, companies can reduce waste and improve their **environmental footprint** while maintaining profitability. 

This unit explores the key components of circular revenue models and how they can be implemented in the fashion system to drive both **sustainability** and **profitability**.

### Case Studies

**For Days**  
For Days is a zero-waste fashion brand that has implemented a subscription-based model, allowing customers to exchange old garments for new ones. The old garments are then recycled into new items, closing the loop on textile waste and promoting a sustainable revenue stream based on recycling and customer loyalty.

### Case studies

#### Mud Jeans – Lease A Jeans  
Mud Jeans, a Dutch denim company, operates a “Lease A Jeans” model in which users pay a monthly fee to wear jeans and return them at end-of-use. The returned garments are repaired for resale, or shredded and recycled into new denim, generating recurring revenue while keeping cotton fibers in a technical loop.

#### For Days – Closed-Loop Membership & Take-Back  
For Days is a U.S.-based circular apparel brand built around a membership and swap model in which users can send back worn items in exchange for credit toward new products. Returned textiles are sorted and recycled into new materials, so revenue is generated both from new garments and from ongoing participation in the take-back system rather than one-off sales.

#### Eileen Fisher – Renew Take-Back and Resale  
Eileen Fisher Renew is a long-running take-back program in which customers return used Eileen Fisher garments in exchange for store credit. Collected pieces are cleaned, repaired, and resold, or remade into new designs, creating an additional revenue stream from existing products while extending garment lifetimes and reducing waste.

#### Patagonia – Worn Wear Repair and Recommerce  
Patagonia’s Worn Wear program invites users to trade in used Patagonia garments for credit, which are then repaired and resold or recycled. The initiative monetizes repair and recommerce services alongside new product sales, strengthening user loyalty through repair events and storytelling while embedding circular practices directly into revenue generation.

#### Levi Strauss & Co. – Levi’s SecondHand  
Levi Strauss & Co. operates Levi’s SecondHand, a buy-back and resale model where customers trade in worn jeans and jackets for gift cards. Items suitable for reuse are cleaned and sold on a dedicated recommerce platform, while others are recycled, allowing Levi’s to earn revenue from multiple lifecycles of the same product and reducing reliance on virgin-material-based sales.
