    <h3> Life-Cycle Costing </h3>
Life-cycle costing (LCC) is an accounting method that considers the total cost of a product throughout its life cycle, from raw material extraction to end-of-lifes disposal. This helps businesses make informed decisions about production, pricing, and sustainability, promoting the use of durable and high-quality products.  
    <br><br><strong> VET: </strong>
Why should we think about all the costs of making, using, and throwing away a product?
    <br><br><strong> HEI: </strong>
How can life cycle costing support sustainability initiatives and improve decision-making in a fashion system?

**Life-Cycle Costing (LCC)** is an accounting method that assesses the total cost of a product throughout its entire life cycle, from the extraction of raw materials to its end-of-life disposal. In the context of the fashion industry, LCC provides businesses with a comprehensive view of the financial and environmental impacts of a product over time. This enables better decision-making around **production, pricing, and sustainability**. By understanding the full cost implications of a product, businesses are able to create durable, high-quality garments that align with **sustainability goals** and meet the growing demand for **responsibly sourced** products. LCC promotes transparency, helping businesses to consider both economic and environmental factors, guiding them toward more sustainable practices.

### Case studies

#### Patagonia – Worn Wear

Patagonia’s Worn Wear program extends the life of garments by buying back, repairing, and reselling used Patagonia products through a dedicated platform. By monetising repair and resale instead of only first-time sales, Patagonia effectively spreads the total life-cycle cost of each item over many years of use, reducing waste and improving the cost-per-wear for users.

#### Mud Jeans – Lease A Jeans

Mud Jeans operates a lease model in which users pay a monthly fee to wear jeans and return them at end of use so the cotton can be mechanically recycled into new denim. This model internalises end-of-life and material recovery costs into the business model, making life-cycle costs visible while reducing raw material demand and landfill waste.

#### Eileen Fisher – Renew

Eileen Fisher Renew is a take-back and resale program that collects worn Eileen Fisher garments, refurbishes them, and resells them through a dedicated channel. By capturing value at multiple stages of the product’s life, the company spreads design and production costs across first and subsequent users, supporting better life-cycle costing decisions and lower impacts per wear.

#### Elvis & Kresse – Fire-Hose Accessories

Elvis & Kresse transforms decommissioned fire hoses and other industrial wastes into luxury bags and accessories, often with long repair guarantees and charitable donations. Their model explicitly accounts for avoided disposal costs and extended product lifetimes, illustrating how life-cycle costs and benefits can be reshaped through upcycling and durable design.

#### For Days – Take-Back and Closed-Loop Basics

For Days offers circular basics with a take-back system in which customers return worn garments in exchange for credit, after which items are sorted for reuse or recycling. This closed-loop setup integrates collection, sorting, and fibre-to-fibre recycling into the revenue model, making end-of-life handling a core cost component rather than an externality.
