    <h3> Technological Dependency </h3>
A company uses many tools, materials, machines in order to create its products and services. Some of these are however more important than others. That means companies are particularly dependent on them. A problem can arise if one of these become unaccessible as the company becomes dependent.
    <br><br><strong> VET: </strong>
On which technologies (Tools, Materials, Software, Machines) do you depend on?
    <br><br><strong> HEI: </strong>
 What is the impact of the technologies needed for your product-service? Can you find alternatives that are more sustainable?

Technological dependency in the fashion industry refers to the reliance on specific tools, materials, machines, or software that are critical for the production and delivery of fashion products and services. Some technologies are more integral to the production process than others, and a company may face significant disruptions if these become inaccessible. This unit explores how fashion companies assess their technological dependencies and the potential risks associated with them. Participants will analyze the impact of these dependencies on the product-service lifecycle and explore sustainable alternatives to reduce reliance on technologies that may pose risks or be unsustainable in the long term.

### Case studies

#### BYBORRE – Digitally-driven 3D knitting ecosystem  
BYBORRE is an Amsterdam-based textile innovation studio whose practice depends on industrial circular knitting machines tightly coupled with a proprietary digital workflow (BYBORRE Create) for parameterized fabric design. The company’s model illustrates technological dependency on specific hardware–software stacks, while its work on more open, modular collaborations with machine builders and software partners shows how this dependency can be managed to increase resilience and flexibility in the textile value chain.

#### Ananas Anam – Piñatex® pineapple-leaf textile  
Ananas Anam produces Piñatex®, a leather alternative made from pineapple leaf fibre, relying on specialized fibre extraction and finishing technologies to convert agricultural waste into a scalable textile material. This creates a strong technological dependency on patented processing methods and dedicated equipment, while demonstrating how process innovation can turn vulnerable raw-material chains into resilient, higher-value textile ecosystems.

#### Ecovative – Forager™ mycelium-based hides  
Ecovative’s Forager™ platform develops mycelium-based hides for fashion, using its proprietary AirMycelium™ growth technology and controlled-environment bioreactors to produce leather-like sheets for footwear, bags, and accessories. The case shows deep dependency on bioprocess engineering, AI-supported growth control, and dedicated fermentation infrastructure, and how modular, distributed production systems can reduce systemic risk while enabling new sustainable materials for fashion.

#### SHIMA SEIKI – WHOLEGARMENT® 3D knit systems  
SHIMA SEIKI’s WHOLEGARMENT® technology provides fully fashioned 3D knitwear on single machines, making many brands and micro-factories dependent on a closed hardware, software, and file-format ecosystem for seamless knit production. This case exemplifies how reliance on a single machinery vendor and proprietary design tools can increase technological lock-in, while also enabling local, on-demand production and material efficiency in knit-based fashion systems.

#### CLO Virtual Fashion – CLO 3D garment simulation  
CLO Virtual Fashion’s CLO 3D software has become core infrastructure for many apparel brands, OEMs, and studios, who depend on its physics-based simulation engine, file formats, and plug-ins for digital sampling and virtual prototyping. The case highlights a growing dependency on specialized design software and cloud services, raising questions of interoperability, data ownership, and long-term access, while also enabling major reductions in physical sampling, lead times, and material waste.
