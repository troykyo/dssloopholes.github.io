Focusing on social responsibility as a holistic topic, this unit delves into the ethical foundations and practices necessary to develop an equitable and sustainable fashion industry. It emphasizes the importance of professional integration and acknowledges the complex interactions between socio-economic factors affecting consumer behavior and industry standards. By developing an understanding of how ethical practices, inclusiveness, and social and economic awareness contribute to the sustainability of the industry, this unit aims to equip learners with the knowledge and skills they need to successfully recommend and implement responsible clothing practices. Through this lens, participants will explore the various dimensions of social equity through the need for all sectors to engage in fair working practices, environmental stewardship, and building positive social impact.


### Case studies

#### VEJA – The VEJA Project  
French sneaker company VEJA builds its business model around social projects, economic justice, and ecological materials, working directly with small-scale farmers in Brazil and Peru and paying above-market prices for organic cotton and Amazonian rubber. Long-term contracts, transparent production reports, and modern slavery statements position VEJA as a reference for how fair-trade relationships and environmental stewardship can be structurally embedded in a fashion company’s operations.

#### Brother Vellies – Sustainability and artisan livelihoods  
Brother Vellies is a Black-owned, women-led accessories label that produces footwear and lifestyle products in collaboration with artisans in South Africa, Kenya, Mexico, Morocco, Ethiopia, Burkina Faso, Italy, Haiti, and New York. Its sustainability programme centres on fair labour practices, year-round pricing that reflects true costs, and the preservation of traditional craft techniques as a pathway to dignified, long-term employment.

#### People Tree – Fair trade fashion and WFTO certification  
People Tree is widely recognised as a pioneer in fair trade fashion, working with artisans and farmers in the Global South under World Fair Trade Organization (WFTO) standards. The brand integrates social responsibility through living-wage commitments, long-term partnerships, and full traceability of garments, positioning fair working conditions and community development as core business values rather than add-ons.

#### European Commission – EU Strategy for Sustainable and Circular Textiles  
The EU Strategy for Sustainable and Circular Textiles sets a policy framework to make textile products more durable, repairable, reusable, and recyclable, while explicitly addressing labour rights, due diligence, and just-transition concerns across global textile value chains. By linking eco-design rules, green claims regulation, and waste legislation to social and environmental responsibility, the strategy turns ethical production and transparency into regulatory expectations rather than voluntary commitments.

#### Clean Clothes Campaign – Global network for garment worker rights  
Clean Clothes Campaign is a global network of over 220 organisations focused on improving working conditions and empowering workers in garment and sportswear factories worldwide. Through worker-centred research, wage-theft campaigns, and brand accountability actions, the network directly targets systemic exploitation, pushing brands and policymakers toward living wages, safe workplaces, and enforceable binding agreements such as post-Rana Plaza factory safety accords.
