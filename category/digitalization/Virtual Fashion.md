    <h3> Virtual Fashion </h3>
Making virtual clothing and textiles (in programs like Clo3D, Browzwear, Blender, or Optitex Lectra) can facilitate fitting, sharing, or entirely digital fashion. Fewer physical garments are needed, and users can even wear the garments digitally.
    <br><br><strong>VET: </strong>
How can creating clothes digitally on a computer change the way we wear and share fashion?
    <br><strong> HEI: </strong>
In what ways can virtual fashion and textiles be better than traditional methods in design, production, fitting, and use?

Virtual sampling is a digital process that involves the creation of virtual prototypes and simulations of garments, accessories, or other fashion products using advanced computer graphics and 3D modeling technologies. It allows designers, brands, and manufacturers to visualize and evaluate the appearance, fit, and overall aesthetics of a product without the need for physical samples. By leveraging virtual sampling, various stages of the product development lifecycle, such as design, pattern-making, fitting, and merchandising, can be streamlined and accelerated.

In the traditional fashion industry, physical sampling requires substantial time, effort, and resources. Designers and manufacturers need to create multiple physical samples, which can be costly and time-consuming. Virtual sampling offers a more efficient and sustainable alternative by enabling the digital representation of products, which can be manipulated and evaluated in a virtual environment.

Through virtual sampling, designers can experiment with different fabrics, colors, patterns, and silhouettes, visualizing how the product will look in a realistic and interactive 3D setting. This allows for faster iterations and modifications, empowering designers to make informed decisions and refine their designs more efficiently. By eliminating the need for physical samples, virtual sampling significantly reduces waste and environmental impact associated with material consumption and production processes.

Furthermore, virtual sampling enables better collaboration and communication among various stakeholders involved in the fashion supply chain. Designers can share digital prototypes with manufacturers, suppliers, and retailers, facilitating clearer communication and reducing the likelihood of errors or misunderstandings. This collaborative approach ensures that everyone involved has a shared understanding of the product's design, resulting in improved accuracy and efficiency throughout the production process.

Virtual sampling also offers advantages in terms of cost savings and time-to-market. By reducing the reliance on physical samples, brands can shorten the product development cycle and respond more quickly to market demands. This agility can be particularly beneficial in the fast-paced fashion industry where trends evolve rapidly. Additionally, virtual sampling allows brands to explore and test innovative designs and concepts without the need for large-scale production, minimizing financial risks.

In summary, virtual sampling represents a transformative shift towards digitization and sustainability. It empowers designers and brands to create, visualize, and evaluate fashion products in a virtual environment, enabling faster iterations, better collaboration, and reduced environmental impact. By harnessing the power of advanced computer graphics and 3D modeling technologies, virtual sampling is revolutionizing the way fashion products are developed, bringing efficiency, cost savings, and enhanced creativity to the industry.

### Professional Reflections

##### Lindex, Nanna Egonsdotter Petersson, 3D Garment Technician
"I like to experiment with different technical solutions when I create my patterns. CLO enables me to do this without wasting any resources, and I can see the results of my patterns straight away. I can now make sure that the fit and size is exactly like my designer has envisioned before I send out any final patterns." 

##### [Taskin Goec-Mixed Reality Designer](https://studiotaskin.com)
"I find that working with CLO is much more dynamic. It allows me to be experimental and quick and try out tons of different things up until the production level. Because designing clothes for production can be quite costly, and with CLO, I make this process much more streamlined." https://www.clo3d.com/en/company/clo-users/stories/53 See other company interviews:, Monica Findeis Freelance 3D Designer  https://www.clo3d.com/en/company/clo-users/stories
