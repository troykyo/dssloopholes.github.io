    <h3> Virtual Fashion </h3>
Making virtual clothing and textiles (in programs like Clo3D, Browzwear, Blender, or Optitex Lectra) can facilitate fitting, sharing, or entirely digital fashion. Fewer physical garments are needed, and users can even wear the garments digitally.
    <br><br><strong>VET: </strong>
How can creating clothes digitally on a computer change the way we wear and share fashion?
    <br><strong> HEI: </strong>
In what ways can virtual fashion and textiles be better than traditional methods in design, production, fitting, and use?

#### What Is Virtual Sampling?
Virtual sampling is a digital process that involves creating virtual prototypes and simulations of garments, accessories, or other fashion products using advanced computer graphics and 3D modeling technologies. It allows designers, brands, and manufacturers to visualize and evaluate the appearance, fit, and overall aesthetics of a product without needing physical samples. This digital approach streamlines various stages of product development, such as design, pattern-making, fitting, and merchandising.

#### The Shift from Physical to Virtual Sampling
In the traditional fashion industry, physical sampling requires significant time, effort, and resources. Designers and manufacturers need to create multiple physical samples, which can be costly and time-consuming. Virtual sampling provides a more efficient and sustainable alternative by enabling digital product representation, which can be manipulated and evaluated in a virtual environment.

#### Design Flexibility & Sustainability
Through virtual sampling, designers can experiment with different fabrics, colors, patterns, and silhouettes in a realistic and interactive 3D setting. This allows for faster iterations and modifications, helping designers refine their designs efficiently. By eliminating the need for physical samples, virtual sampling significantly reduces material waste and environmental impact associated with traditional production processes.

#### Improved Collaboration & Accuracy
Virtual sampling enhances collaboration and communication among stakeholders in the fashion supply chain. Designers can share digital prototypes with manufacturers, suppliers, and retailers, ensuring clearer communication and reducing the likelihood of errors or misunderstandings. This shared understanding improves accuracy and efficiency throughout the production process.

#### Cost Savings & Market Agility
Virtual sampling reduces costs and shortens the product development cycle by minimizing reliance on physical samples. This enables brands to respond quickly to market trends, an essential advantage in the fast-paced fashion industry. Additionally, virtual sampling allows brands to test innovative designs without large-scale production, minimizing financial risks.

In summary, virtual sampling represents a transformative shift towards digitization and sustainability in fashion. It empowers designers and brands to create, visualize, and evaluate products in a virtual environment, leading to faster iterations, improved collaboration, and reduced environmental impact. By leveraging advanced computer graphics and 3D modeling technologies, virtual sampling is revolutionizing fashion development, bringing efficiency, cost savings, and enhanced creativity to the industry.

### Professional Reflections

##### Lindex, Nanna Egonsdotter Petersson, 3D Garment Technician
"I like to experiment with different technical solutions when I create my patterns. CLO enables me to do this without wasting any resources, and I can see the results of my patterns straight away. I can now make sure that the fit and size is exactly like my designer has envisioned before I send out any final patterns." 

##### [Taskin Goec-Mixed Reality Designer](https://studiotaskin.com)
"I find that working with CLO is much more dynamic. It allows me to be experimental and quick and try out tons of different things up until the production level. Because designing clothes for production can be quite costly, and with CLO, I make this process much more streamlined." https://www.clo3d.com/en/company/clo-users/stories/53
