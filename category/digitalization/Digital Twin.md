    <h3> Digital Twin </h3>
A digital twin is a digital model of a physical product, process, or system. In fashion, this could mean a detailed, dynamic 3D model (or, more often, a data model) of a garment, factory, store, entire value chain, and/or the interaction of many value chains. This helps us understand how product/service eco-systems are working at a practical level.

Digital twins are virtual representations of physical products, systems, or processes. They are created using digital models that mirror the characteristics and behavior of their real-world counterparts. These virtual twins are updated in real-time or periodically throughout the life-cycle of the product or system, capturing data and enabling analysis, simulation, and optimization.  In the fashion industry, digital twins can be used to enhance various aspects of the product life-cycle, from design and production to retail and post-user stages.

#### Design and development

Digital twins can be used during the design phase to visualize and simulate garments or fashion collections. Designers can create virtual prototypes that closely resemble the physical products, allowing them to evaluate different design options, materials, and fit. This helps reduce the need for physical samples and iterations, saving time, cost, and resources.

#### Supply chain optimization

Digital twins enable real-time monitoring and optimization of supply chain processes in the fashion industry. By creating virtual representations of production facilities, logistics networks, and inventory systems, companies can simulate different scenarios, analyze performance, and identify opportunities for improvement. This helps optimize production planning, reduce waste, and enhance overall supply chain efficiency.

#### Personalized customer experience

Digital twins can be used to create virtual avatars or models that represent individual customers. By capturing data on body measurements, preferences, and style, companies can offer personalized recommendations for sizing, fit, and styling choices. This enhances the online shopping experience, reduces returns, and improves customer satisfaction.

#### Sustainability and circular economy

Digital twins facilitate the implementation of sustainable practices in the fashion industry. By capturing data on the materials used, energy utilization, and environmental impacts, companies can analyze and optimize the sustainability performance of their products. Digital twins can also aid in tracking and managing the entire life-cycle of garments, from production to recycling or upcycling, promoting circular economy practices.

#### Smart retail and inventory management

Digital twins can be utilized in retail stores to optimize inventory management and improve customer experience. By creating virtual representations of products and store layouts, companies can simulate and analyze customer flow, optimize shelf space, and forecast demand. This enables more efficient stock replenishment, reduces overstocking or understocking, and enhances the overall shopping experience.

#### Post-user engagement

Digital twins can be used to engage customers even after purchase. For example, by creating digital twins of fashion items in the hands of customers, companies can offer styling tips, care instructions, and customization options. This fosters a deeper connection with customers, promotes product longevity, and encourages sustainable utilization habits.

Overall, digital twins offer immense potential for the fashion industry by enabling virtual simulations, real-time monitoring, and optimization throughout the product life-cycle. They help enhance design, streamline supply chains, personalize customer experiences, promote sustainability, and improve overall operational efficiency

### Case studies

#### Tommy Hilfiger's digital showroom

Tommy Hilfiger implemented a digital twin-based virtual showroom that revolutionized their design and development process. Using 3D digital models and virtual simulations, designers and buyers could visualize and evaluate collections without the need for physical samples. This streamlined the design process, reduced costs, and accelerated time-to-market. [More about Tommy Hilfiger's Digital Showroom](https://www.tommy.com/en_int/digital-showroom)

#### Zara's smart retail system

Zara, a global fashion retailer, utilizes digital twins and RFID technology to optimize inventory management and enhance the in-store shopping experience. Digital twins of garments are created and linked to RFID tags, enabling real-time tracking and monitoring of stock levels. This helps Zara to efficiently manage inventory, restock popular items, and provide customers with accurate information on product availability.
